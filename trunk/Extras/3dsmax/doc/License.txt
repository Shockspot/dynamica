Welcome to the new world of reality gaming brought to you by PhysX™ acceleration from NVIDIA®.

NVIDIA Corporation is willing to license the PHYSX SDK and the accompanying documentation to you only on the condition that you accept all the terms in this License Agreement (“Agreement”). 

IMPORTANT: READ THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS BEFORE USING THE ACCOMPANYING NVIDIA PHYSX SDK. 
BY CLICKING ON THE "ACCEPT” BUTTON, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ THIS AGREEMENT, UNDERSTAND IT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, NVIDIA IS NOT WILLING TO LICENSE THE PHYSX SDK TO YOU.

1. Definitions. “Physics Application” means a software application designed for use and fully compatible with the PhysX SDK and/or NVIDIA Graphics processor products, including but not limited to, a video game, visual simulation, movie, or other product. “PhysX Software Development Kit” or “PhysX SDK” means the set of instructions for computers, in executable form and in any media (which may include diskette, CD-ROM, downloadable internet, hardware, or firmware) comprising NVIDIA’s proprietary Software Development Kit and related media and printed materials, including Redistributable Code, Sample Code, reference guides and manuals, installation routines, PhysX drivers, API’s, libraries, any subsequent updates or adaptations provided by NVIDIA, whether with this installation or as separately downloaded. “Redistributable Code” means the Sample Code and any object code files located in the “\SDKs\lib\” and “\Tools\NXuStream2” directories of the PhysX SDK. “Sample Code” means the sample interface or application source and object code files contained within the PhysX SDK’s “Samples” directory or made available for download from the PhysX developer site and designated as sample code. 

2. License. NVIDIA Corporation (“NVIDIA”) grants you (“you”) a limited, nonexclusive, non-transferable world-wide, royalty-free license to (a) internally install, use and display the PhysX SDK, solely for purposes of developing Physics Applications; (b) internally use, copy, modify and compile the Sample Code to design, develop and test 
Physics Applications; and (c) reproduce and distribute the Redistributable Code only in object code form and only as fully integrated into Physics Applications, provided you meet and comply with all requirements of this Agreement. Any terms or conditions appearing on the face or reverse side of any purchase order, purchase order acknowledgment or other order document that are different from, or in addition to, the terms of this Agreement will not be binding on the parties, even if payment is accepted. Except as expressly granted herein, no other license under any patent, copyright, trade secret, trademark or other intellectual property right is granted to or conferred upon you by this Agreement. All other rights are expressly reserved by NVIDIA and its licensors. 

3. Redistribution; Physics Applications. Any redistribution of the PhysX SDK or portions thereof must be subject to an end user license agreement including language that (a) prohibits the end user from modifying, reproducing, de-compiling, reverse 
engineering or translating the PhysX SDK; (b) prohibits the end user from distributing or transferring the PhysX SDK other than as part of the Physics Application; (c) disclaims any and all warranties on behalf of NVIDIA and its affiliated companies and licensors; (d) disclaims, to the maximum extent permitted by law, NVIDIA’s, its affiliated companies and its licensors' liability for all damages, direct or indirect, incidental or consequential, that may arise from any use of the PhysX SDK and/or Physics Application; and (e) requires the end user to agree not to export the PhysX SDK and/or Physics Application, directly or indirectly, in violation of any U.S. laws. Upon request, you must provide NVIDIA with two (2) copies of any Physics Application and related documentation that is commercially released subject to a license enabling NVIDIA to use and publicly display reasonable portions of such Physics Application for advertising purposes.

4. Ownership, Protections. The PhysX SDK is owned by NVIDIA and NVIDIA licensors, and is protected by United States copyright laws, international treaty provisions, and other applicable laws. With regard to any copies made, you agree to reproduce any copyright notices and other proprietary legends included on the original. NVIDIA copyright notice(s) may appear in any of several forms, including machine-readable form, and you agree to reproduce such notice in each form in which it appears. Title and copyrights to the PhysX SDK and any copies made by you remain with NVIDIA and its licensors. You acknowledge that the PhysX SDK contain valuable proprietary information and trade secrets and that unauthorized or improper use of the PhysX SDK will result in irreparable harm to NVIDIA and its licensors for which monetary damages would be inadequate and for which NVIDIA and its licensors will be entitled to immediate injunctive relief. Subject to the rights of NVIDIA and its licensors in the PhysX SDK and the Sample Code, you own your modifications to the Sample Code. 

5. Restrictions. You will not, and will not permit others to: (a) modify, translate, decompile, bootleg, reverse engineer, disassemble, or extract the inner workings of any portion of the PhysX SDK except the Sample Code, (b) copy the look-and-feel or functionality of any portion of the PhysX SDK except the Sample Code; (c) remove any proprietary notices, marks, labels, or logos from the PhysX SDK or any portion thereof; (d) rent, transfer or use as a service bureau all or some of the PhysX SDK without NVIDIA’s prior written consent, except in the form of Physics Applications and subject to the requirements of this Agreement; or (e) utilize any computer software or hardware which is designed to defeat any copy protection device, should the PhysX SDK be equipped with such a protection device. Unauthorized copying of the PhysX SDK, or failure to comply with any of the provisions of this Agreement, will result in automatic termination of this license. 

6. Attribution Requirements and Trademark License. You must provide attribution to NVIDIA, PhysX. by NVIDIA, and the NVIDIA PhysX SDK. You will include a reference to the PhysX SDK and NVIDIA in any press releases for such Game that relate to NVIDIA, or in-game physics, and will identify NVIDIA as the provider of the "Physics Engine" (or such other term or phrase as indicated by NVIDIA from time to time). For Games and Demos that incorporate the PhysX SDK or portions thereof, the NVIDIA logo must appear, (a) on the back cover of the instruction manual or similar placement in an electronic file, (b) on external packaging and, (c) in the “About” or “Info” box menu items (or equivalent) of all Physics Applications using any portion of the PhysX SDK in the format as specified at http://www.nvidia.com/physx Except as expressly set forth in this Section 6, or in a separate written agreement with NVIDIA, you may not use NVIDIA's trademarks, whether registered or unregistered, in connection with the Physics Application in any manner or imply that NVIDIA endorses or otherwise approves of the Physics Application or that you and NVIDIA are in any way affiliated. Your use of the NVIDIA name under this Agreement does not create any right, title or interest in the NVIDIA name or any NVIDIA trademarks and all goodwill arising from your use inure solely to the benefit of NVIDIA.
