= Windows and Linux =

The easiest way to build Dynamica is using cmake-gui. All the external dependencies are already included in the Dynamica source tree, except for the Maya plug-in SDK.

When running cmake-gui, type configure and make sure the Maya location under MAYA_BASE_DIR is properly set, so that the plug-in SDK can be found. It can be adjusted manually if necessary.

Once you build the project, it will create a Maya plugin under libs/Release/plug-ins

= Mac OSX =

Open a terminal window

{{{
cd /dynamica/Extras/MayaPlugin
make -f Makefile.mac
make -f Makefile.mac install
}}}

It might be necessary to adjust the location of the Maya base directory.
Either set the environment variable MAYA_LOCATION using
{{{
export MAYA_LOCATION=/Applications/Autodesk/maya2010/devkit
}}}

or you can set it manually at the top of Makefile.mac file, using a text editor.
